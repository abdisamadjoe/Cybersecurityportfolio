# Controls and Compliance Checklist Exemplar for Botium Toys

## Controls Assessment Checklist

| Yes | No | Control | Explanation |
| --- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
|  | ✔️ | **Least Privilege** | Currently, all employees have access to customer data; privileges need to be limited to reduce the risk of a breach. |
|  | ✔️ | **Disaster Recovery Plans** | There are no disaster recovery plans in place. These need to be implemented to ensure business continuity. |
|  | ✔️ | **Password Policies** | Employee password requirements are minimal, which could allow a threat actor to more easily access secure data/other assets via employee work equipment/the internal network. |
|  | ✔️ | **Separation of Duties** | Needs to be implemented to reduce the possibility of fraud/access to critical data, since the company CEO currently runs day-to-day operations and manages the payroll. |
| ✔️ |  | **Firewall** | The existing firewall blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules. |
|  | ✔️ | **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | The IT department needs an IDS in place to help identify possible intrusions by threat actors. |
| ✔️ |  | **Backups** | The IT department needs to have backups of critical data, in case of a breach, to ensure business continuity. |
| ✔️ |  | **Antivirus Software** | Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. |
|  | ✔️ | **Manual Monitoring, Maintenance, and Intervention for Legacy Systems** | The list of assets notes the use of legacy systems. The risk assessment indicates that these systems are monitored and maintained, but there is not a regular schedule in place for this task and procedures/policies related to intervention are unclear, which could place these systems at risk of a breach. |
|  | ✔️ | **Encryption** | Encryption is not currently used; implementing it would provide greater confidentiality of sensitive information. |
|  | ✔️ | **Password Management System** | There is no password management system currently in place; implementing this control would improve IT department/other employee productivity in the case of password issues. |
| ✔️ |  | **Locks (Offices, Storefront, Warehouse)** | The store’s physical location, which includes the company’s main offices, storefront, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks. |

## Recommendations (Optional)

Multiple controls need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an IDS, ongoing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system.

To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
